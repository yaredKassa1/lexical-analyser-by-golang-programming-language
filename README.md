Lexical Analyzer with Golang Programming Language
#Project Description
This project implements a lexical analyzer (lexer) using the Go programming language. The lexer reads source code from a file, tokenizes it into meaningful components (keywords, operators, delimiters, identifiers, and literals), and reports any lexical errors encountered during the analysis. It serves as a foundational tool for building compilers or interpreters, helping to understand the structure and components of source code.

#Instructions for Running the Program
Install Go: Ensure that you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Go website: golang.org.
Clone or Download the Project: Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Prepare Input File: Create or modify a text file containing the Go source code that you want to analyze. Name it input.txt.
Run the Lexer:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the lexicalAnalyser.go file is located.
Execute the following command:
bash
go run lexicalAnalyser.go input.txt
View Output: After running the command, the terminal will display the tokens identified in the source code along with their types, line numbers, and column numbers. Any errors will also be reported.
